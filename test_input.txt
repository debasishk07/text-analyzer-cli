The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, a classic phrase often used for testing font displays.

 Today, however, our focus shifts to a more complex data set. Consider this paragraph, comprising exactly 200 words, punctuated with commas, periods, and the occasional exclamation mark! We also have numbers like 12345, special characters such as #@$%^&*, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
 
  The script should be robust enough to handle variations in sentence structure, line breaks (if you copy-paste this into a multi-line string), and the subtle nuances of natural language.
  
   It's crucial that it accurately identifies individual words, counts their occurrences, or perhaps even performs a sentiment analysis. Remember to account for edge cases, like contractions (e.g., isn't, don't) and hyphenated words (e.g., high-quality). This comprehensive test will reveal any hidden bugs or inefficiencies. 
   
   The ultimate goal is a script that processes text seamlessly, regardless of its content or formatting quirks. Good luck with your testing endeavors!
